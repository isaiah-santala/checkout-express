Technology Used

    For this project, I used react compiled by babel and bundled by webpack into bundle,js on the front end. For now, it is host on the local host using express server but it will eventually be deployed on AWS.

    On the back end, I it is using Mysql as database populated via knex with seed data generated by faker.js in the schema that I designed. 

    In regard of testing, I chose jest to create the test environment and enzyme as the testing utility.

    The reason for the choise of technology for this assignment are to use and familiarize with the most current industry standard tools for building a full stack app. 

Instructino for setup; 

    npm run webpack => will start bundling and watch changes with in the src folder
    npm run server  => will run index.js file in server to start initiate the server and serve the app on localhost port 3000
